    :summary: Assigns Dwarves to a military squad until they have fulfilled their need for Martial Training
    :tags: fort auto bugfix units

Code for dwarves to hit the gym when they yearn for the gains. Also passively builds military skills and physical stats.

Critical setup:

- Minimum 1 squad with the correct name (default is "Gym")
- An assigned squad leader in the squad
- An assigned Barracks for the squad
- Active Training orders for the squad

This should be a new non-military-use squad. The uniform should be set to "No Uniform" and the squad should be set to "Constant Training" in the military screen.
Set the squad's schedule to full time training with at least 8 or 9 training.
The squad doesn't need months off. The members leave the squad once they have gotten their gains.

NOTE: Dwarfs with the labor "Fish Dissection" enabled are ignored. Make a Dwarven labour with only the Fish Dissection enabled, set to "Only selected do this" and assign it to a dwarf to ignore them.
