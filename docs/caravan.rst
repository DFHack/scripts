    :summary: Adjust properties of caravans on the map.
    :tags: fort armok bugfix

This tool can help with caravans that are leaving too quickly, refuse to unload,
or are just plain unhappy that you are such a poor negotiator.

Also see `force` for creating caravans.

Usage
-----

::

    caravan [list]
    caravan extend [<days> [<ids>]]
    caravan happy [<ids>]
    caravan leave [<ids>]
    caravan unload

Commands listed with the argument ``[<ids>]`` can take multiple
(space-separated) caravan IDs (see ``caravan list`` to get the IDs). If no IDs
are specified, then the commands apply to all caravans on the map.

Examples
--------

``caravan``
    List IDs and information about all caravans on the map.
``caravan extend``
    Force a caravan that is leaving to return to the depot and extend their
    stay another 7 days.
``caravan extend 30 0 1``
    Extend the time that caravans 0 and 1 stay at the depot by 30 days. If the
    caravans have already started leaving, they will return to the depot.
``caravan happy``
    Make the active caravans willing to trade again (after seizing goods,
    annoying merchants, etc.). If the caravan has already started leaving in a
    huff, they will return to the depot.
``caravan leave``
    Makes caravans pack up and leave immediately.
``caravan unload``
    Fix a caravan that got spooked by wildlife and refuses to fully unload.

Overlays
--------

Additional functionality is provided on the various trade-related screens via
`overlay` widgets.

Trade screen
````````````

- ``Shift+Click checkbox``: Select all items inside a bin without selecting the
    bin itself
- ``Ctrl+Click checkbox``: Collapse or expand a single bin (as is possible in
    the "Move goods to/from depot" screen)
- ``Ctrl+c``: Collapses all bins. The hotkey hint can also be clicked as though
    it were a button.
- ``Ctrl+x``: Collapses everything (all item categories and anything
    collapsible within each category). The hotkey hint can also be clicked as
    though it were a button.

There is also a reminder of the fast scroll functionality provided by the
vanilla game when you hold shift while scrolling (this works everywhere).

You can turn the overlay on and off in `gui/control-panel`, or you can
reposition it to your liking with `gui/overlay`. The overlay is named
``caravan.tradeScreenExtension``.

Bring item to depot
```````````````````

When the trade depot is selected, a button appears to bring up the DFHack
enhanced move trade goods screen. You'll get a searchable, sortable list of all
your tradeable items, with hotkeys to quickly select or deselect all visible
items.

There are filter sliders for selecting items of various condition levels and
quality. For example, you can quickly trade all your tattered, frayed, and worn
clothing by setting the condition slider to include from tattered to worn, then
hitting Ctrl-V to select all.

Click on an item and shift-click on a second item to toggle all items between
the two that you clicked on. If the one that you shift-clicked on was selected,
the range of items will be deselected. If the one you shift-clicked on was not
selected, then the range of items will be selected.

Trade agreement
```````````````

A small panel is shown with a hotkey (``Ctrl-A``) for selecting all/none in the
currently shown category.

Display furniture
`````````````````

A button is added to the screen when you are viewing display furniture
(pedestals and display cases) where you can launch an item assignment GUI.

The dialog allows you to sort by name, value, or where the item is currently
assigned for display.

You can search by name, and you can filter by item quality and by whether the
item is forbidden.
