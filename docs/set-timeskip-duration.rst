set-timeskip-duration
=====================
Starting a new fortress/adventurer session is preceded by
an "Updating World" process which is normally 2 weeks long.
This script allows you to modify the duration of this timeskip,
enabling you to jump into the game earlier or later than usual.

You can use this at any point before the timeskip begins
(for example, while still at the "Start Playing" menu).

It is also possible to run the script while the world is updating,
which can be useful if you decide to end the process earlier
or later than initially planned.

Note that the change in timeskip duration will persist until either

- the game is closed,
- the "-clear" argument is used (see below),
- or it is overwritten by setting a new duration.

The timeskip duration can be specified using any combination of
the following arguments.

Usage::

    -ticks X
        Replace "X" with a positive integer (or 0)
        Adds the specified number of ticks to the timeskip duration
        The following conversions may help you calculate this:
            1 tick = 72 seconds = 1 minute 12 seconds
            50 ticks = 60 minutes = 1 hour
            1200 ticks = 24 hours = 1 day
            8400 ticks = 7 days = 1 week
            33600 ticks = 4 weeks = 1 month
            403200 ticks = 12 months = 1 year

    -years X
        Replace "X" with a positive integer (or 0)
        Adds (403200 multiplied by X) ticks to the timeskip duration

    -months X
        Replace "X" with a positive integer (or 0)
        Adds (33600 multiplied by X) ticks to the timeskip duration

    -days X
        Replace "X" with a positive integer (or 0)
        Adds (1200 multiplied by X) ticks to the timeskip duration

    -hours X
        Replace "X" with a positive integer (or 0)
        Adds (50 multiplied by X) ticks to the timeskip duration

    -clear
        This resets the timeskip duration to its default value.
        Note that it won't affect timeskips which have already begun.

Example::

    set-timeskip-duration -ticks 851249
        Sets the end of the timeskip to
        2 years, 1 month, 9 days, 8 hours, 58 minutes, 48 seconds
        from the current date.

    set-timeskip-duration -years 2 -months 1 -days 9 -hours 8 -ticks 49
        Does the same thing as the previous example
