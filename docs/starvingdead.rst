starvingdead
============
Somewhere between a "mod" and a "fps booster", with a small impact on
vanilla gameplay. It mostly helps prevent undead cascades in the caverns,
where constant combat leads to hundreds of undead roaming the
caverns and destroying your FPS.

With this script running, all undead that have been on the map for
one month gradually decay, losing strength, speed, and toughness.
After six months, they collapse upon themselves, never to be reanimated.

Usage: ``starvingdead (start|stop)``
