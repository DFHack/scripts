Enables the player to take control of their adventurer's killer.
Run this script after being presented with "You are deceased."

The killer is identified by examining the historical event
generated when the adventurer died. If this is unsuccessful,
the killer is assumed to be the last unit to have attacked the
adventurer prior to their death.

This will fail if the unit in question is no longer present
on the local map.

(Adventure mode only!)
