questport
=========
Teleports your adventurer to the location of your quest log map cursor.

Use by opening the quest log map and moving the cursor to your target location
before running the script. Note that this can be done both within and outside of
fast travel mode, and that it is possible to questport in situations where
fast travel is normally prohibited.

It is currently not possible to questport into inaccessible locations like
ocean and mountain tiles.

See `reveal-adv-map` if you wish to teleport into hidden map tiles.
