colonies
========
List vermin colonies, place honey bees, or convert all vermin
to honey bees.  Usage:

:colonies:          List all vermin colonies on the map.
:colonies place:    Place a honey bee colony under the cursor.
:colonies convert:  Convert all existing colonies to honey bees.

The ``place`` and ``convert`` subcommands by default create or
convert to honey bees, as this is the most commonly useful.
However both accept an optional flag to use a different vermin
type, for example ``colonies place ANT`` creates an ant colony
and ``colonies convert TERMITE`` ends your beekeeping industry.
