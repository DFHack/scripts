rejuvenate
==========
Decreases the age of the selected dwarf to 20 years. Useful if valuable citizens
are getting old.

Arguments:

- ``-all``: applies to all citizens
- ``-force``: also applies to units under 20 years old. Useful if there are too many babies around...
- ``-dry-run``: only list units that would be changed; don't actually change ages
