    :summary: Toggles the keyboard cursor.
    :tags: interface

This tool simply toggles the keyboard cursor so you can quickly switch it on when you need it. Many other tools, like `autodump`, need a keyboard cursor for selecting a target tile. Note that you'll still need to enter an interface mode where the keyboard cursor is visible, like mining mode or dumping mode, in order to use the cursor.
