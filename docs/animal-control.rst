animal-control
==============
Animal control is a script useful for deciding what animals to butcher and geld.

While not as powerful as Dwarf Therapist in managing animals - in so far as
DT allows you to sort by various stats and flags - this script does provide
many options for filtering animals. Additionally you can mark animals for
slaughter or gelding, you can even do so enmasse if you so choose.

Examples::

  animal-control -race DOG
  animal-control -race DOG -male -notgelded -showstats
  animal-control -markfor gelding -id 1988
  animal-control -markfor slaughter -id 1988
  animal-control -gelded -markedfor slaughter -unmarkfor slaughter
