catsplosion
===========
Makes cats (and other animals) just *multiply*. It is not a good idea to run this
more than once or twice.

Usage:

:catsplosion:           Make all cats pregnant
:catsplosion list:      List IDs of all animals on the map
:catsplosion ID ...:    Make animals with given ID(s) pregnant

Animals will give birth within two in-game hours (100 ticks or fewer).
