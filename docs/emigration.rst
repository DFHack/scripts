emigration
==========
Allows dwarves to emigrate from the fortress when stressed,
in proportion to how badly stressed they are and adjusted
for who they would have to leave with - a dwarven merchant
being more attractive than leaving alone (or with an elf).
The check is made monthly.

A happy dwarf (ie with negative stress) will never emigrate.
