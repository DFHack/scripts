view-item-info
==============
A script to extend the item or unit viewscreen with additional information
including a custom description of each item (when available), and properties
such as material statistics, weapon attacks, armor effectiveness, and more.

The associated script `item-descriptions` supplies custom descriptions
of items.  Individual descriptions can be added or overridden by a similar
script :file:`raw/scripts/more-item-descriptions.lua`.  Both work as sparse lists,
so missing items simply go undescribed if not defined in the fallback.
