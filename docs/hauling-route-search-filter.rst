Summary:
Add a search box to the Hauling menu to filter hauling routes.
This overlay adds a Filter field to the Hauling menu (opened with h). The list of hauling routes updates as you type. You can activate the filter by clicking the field or pressing Alt+S. Clearing the field shows the full list again, including any routes or stops added while the filter was active.
