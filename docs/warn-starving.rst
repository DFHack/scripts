warn-starving
=============
If any (live) units are starving, very thirsty, or very drowsy, the game will
be paused and a warning shown and logged to the console. If you only want
to be warned about sane dwarves, use ``warn-starving sane``.

Use with the `repeat` command for regular checks.

Use ``warn-starving all`` to display a list of all problematic units.
