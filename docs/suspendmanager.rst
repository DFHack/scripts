    :summary: Intelligently suspend and unsuspend jobs.
    :tags: fort auto jobs

This tool will watch your active jobs and:

- unsuspend jobs that have become suspended due to inaccessible materials,
    items temporarily in the way, or worker dwarves getting scared by wildlife
- suspend most construction jobs that would prevent a dwarf from reaching another
    construction job, such as when building a wall corner or high walls
- suspend construction jobs on top of a smoothing, engraving or track carving
  designation. This prevents the construction job from being completed first,
  which would erase the designation.
