adventure mode whilst giving up control of their current player character.

To specify the target unit, simply select it in the user interface,
such as by opening the unit's status screen or viewing its description,
and enter "bodyswap" in the DFHack console.

Alternatively, the target unit can be specified by its unit id as shown below.

Arguments::

        replace "id" with the unit id of your target
