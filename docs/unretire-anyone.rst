unretire-anyone
===============
This script allows the user to play as any living (or undead)
historical figure (except for deities) in adventure mode.

To use, simply enter "unretire-anyone" in the DFHack console
at the start of adventure mode character creation. You will be
presented with a searchable list from which you may choose
your desired historical figure.

This figure will be added to the 'Specific Person' list at the
bottom of the creature selection page. They can then be picked
for use as a player character, as if regaining control of a
retired adventurer.
