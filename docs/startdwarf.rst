startdwarf
==========
Use before embarking (e.g. at the site selection screen or any time before) to
change the number of dwarves you embark with from the default of 7.

- ``startdwarf 10`` would just allow a few more warm bodies to dig in
- ``startdwarf 500`` would lead to a severe food shortage and FPS issues

The number must be 7 or greater.
