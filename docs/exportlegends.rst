.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Exports extended legends data for external viewing.
    :tags: legends inspection

When run from the legends mode screen, you can export detailed data about your
world so that it can be browsed with external programs like
:forums:`Legends Browser <179848>` and other similar utilities. The data
exported with this tool is more detailed than what you can get with vanilla
export functionality, and some external tools depend on this extra information.

To use:

- enter legends mode
- click the vanilla "Export XML" button to get the standard export
- run this command (``exportlegends``) to get the extended export

Usage
