Revives the specified historical figure, even if off-site.

Any future desired future interactions with an NPC, who died at an unknown spot or inaccessible location,
can have be revived to a degree using this function.

This function is still in development, and may cause strange bugs.
This is because the revived historical figures will lack a physical body associated with them.

Usage::

    devel/revive-hf HISTFIG_ID

Arguments:

``histfig_id``:
    the ID of the historical figure to target
