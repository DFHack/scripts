reveal-adv-map
==============

This script can be used to either reveal or hide all tiles on the
world map in adventure mode (visible when viewing the quest log
or fast travelling, for example).

Note that the script does not reveal hidden lairs, camps, etc.
See `reveal-hidden-sites` for this functionality.

Arguments::

    -hide
        Include this if you want to hide all world tiles instead
        of revealing them
