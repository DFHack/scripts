reveal-hidden-sites
===================
This script reveals all sites in the world
that have yet to be discovered by the player
(camps, lairs, shrines, vaults, etc)
thus making them visible on the map.

Usable in both fortress and adventure mode.

See `reveal-adv-map` if you also want to expose
hidden world map tiles in adventure mode.
