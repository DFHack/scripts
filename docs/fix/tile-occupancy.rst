fix/tile-occupancy
==================
Clears bad occupancy flags at the selected tile. Useful for getting rid of
phantom "building present" messages. Currently only supports issues with
building and unit occupancy. Requires that a tile is selected with the in-game
cursor (``k``).

Can be used to fix problematic tiles caused by :issue:`1047`.
