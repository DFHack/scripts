gui/embark-anywhere
===================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Embark wherever you want.
    :tags: embark armok interface

If you run this command when you're choosing a site for embark, you can bypass
any warnings the game gives you about potential embark locations. Want to
embark in an inaccessible location on top of a mountain range? Go for it! Want
to try a brief existence in the middle of the ocean? Nobody can stop you! Want
to tempt fate by embarking *inside of* a necromancer tower? !!FUN!!

Any and all consequences of embarking in strange locations are up to you to
handle (possibly with other `armok <armok-tag-index>` tools).

Usage
-----

::

    gui/embark-anywhere

The command will only work when you are on the screen where you can choose your
embark site. The DFHack logo is not displayed on that screen since its default
position conflicts with the vanilla embark size selection panel. Remember that
you can bring up DFHack's `context menu <hotkeys>` with
:kbd:`Ctrl`:kbd:`Shift`:kbd:`C` or the
`in-game command launcher <gui/launcher>` directly with the backtick key (\`).
