gui/blueprint
=============
The `blueprint` plugin records the structure of a portion of your fortress in
a blueprint file that you (or anyone else) can later play back with `quickfort`.

This script provides a visual, interactive interface to make configuring and
using the blueprint plugin much easier.

Usage::

    gui/blueprint [<name> [<phases>]] [<options>]

All parameters are optional. Anything you specify will override the initial
values set in the interface. See the `blueprint` documentation for information
on the possible parameters and options.
