==================
Activate in the :guilabel:`Equip->View/Customize` page of the military screen.

Depending on the cursor location, it rewrites all 'individual choice weapon' entries
in the selected squad or position to use a specific weapon type matching the assigned
unit's top skill. If the cursor is in the rightmost list over a weapon entry, it rewrites
only that entry, and does it even if it is not 'individual choice'.

Rationale: individual choice seems to be unreliable when there is a weapon shortage,
and may lead to inappropriate weapons being selected.
