gui/mechanisms
==============
Lists mechanisms connected to the building, and their links. Navigating
the list centers the view on the relevant linked buildings.

To exit, press :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`Enter`; :kbd:`Esc` recenters on
the original building, while :kbd:`Enter` leaves focus on the current
one. :kbd:`Shift`:kbd:`Enter` has an effect equivalent to pressing
:kbd:`Enter`, and then re-entering the mechanisms UI.
