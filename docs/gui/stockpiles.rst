gui/stockpiles
==============
An in-game interface for `stocksettings`, to
load and save stockpile settings from the :kbd:`q` menu.

Usage:

:gui/stockpiles -save:         to save the current stockpile
:gui/stockpiles -load:         to load settings into the current stockpile
:gui/stockpiles -dir <path>:   set the default directory to save settings into
:gui/stockpiles -help:         to see this message

Don't forget to ``enable stockpiles`` and create the ``stocksettings`` directory in
the DF folder before trying to use the GUI.
