    :summary: Virtual keyboard for typing with the mouse.
    :tags: dfhack

This tool provides an in-game virtual keyboard. You can choose from all the
characters that DF supports (code page 437). Just click on the characters to
build the text that you want to send to the parent screen. The text is sent
as soon as you hit :kbd:`Enter`, so make sure there is a text field selected
in the parent window before starting this UI!
