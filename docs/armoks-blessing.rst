armoks-blessing
===============
Runs the equivalent of `rejuvenate`, `elevate-physical`, `elevate-mental`, and
`brainwash` on all dwarves currently on the map.  This is an extreme change,
which sets every stat and trait to an ideal easy-to-satisfy preference.

Without providing arguments, only attributes, age, and personalities will be adjusted.
Adding arguments allows for skills or classes to be adjusted to legendary (maximum).

Arguments:

- ``list``
   Prints list of all skills

- ``classes``
   Prints list of all classes

- ``all``
   Set all skills, for all Dwarves, to legendary

- ``<skill name>``
   Set a specific skill, for all Dwarves, to legendary

   example: ``armoks-blessing RANGED_COMBAT``

   All Dwarves become a Legendary Archer

- ``<class name>``
   Set a specific class (group of skills), for all Dwarves, to legendary

   example: ``armoks-blessing Medical``

   All Dwarves will have all medical related skills set to legendary
