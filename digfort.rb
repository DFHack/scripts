=======
**Digfort has been removed.** Please use DFHack's more powerful `quickfort`
script instead. You can use your existing .csv files. Just move them to the
``blueprints`` folder in your DF installation, and instead of ``digfort
file.csv`` run ``quickfort run file.csv``.

puts "The digfort script has been removed. Please move your blueprints to the 'blueprints' folder (under your DF installation directory) and use DFHack's quickfort command instead:\n  quickfort run example.csv"
